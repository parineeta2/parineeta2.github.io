# **Vector Dot Product Implementation**

This repository contains an implementation of the **vector dot product** algorithm. The dot product is a fundamental operation in linear algebra used in fields such as computer graphics, machine learning, and physics.

---

## **Mathematical Expression**

The dot product of two vectors **A** and **B** of length **n** is calculated as:

$$A \cdot B = \sum_{i=1}^n A_i \times B_i$$

Where:
- \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) are the elements of vectors \(A\) and \(B\), respectively.
- \(n\) is the number of elements in each vector.

## **Code Snippet**

![Vector Diagram](vec.jpg)

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation of the vector dot product:

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    if len(vector_a) != len(vector_b):
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

# Example usage
vector_a = [5, 8, 1]
vector_b = [3, 5, 6]
print("Dot Product:", result)
